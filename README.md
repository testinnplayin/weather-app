This is a Free Code Camp project that asks us to build a small app that produces the local weather. The project can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather
This is built first with Atom and will exist on GitHub. A display version can be found at http://codepen.io/testinnplayin/details/LRpNBY/
This app uses to APIs, one powered by IP-API and the other by OpenWeatherMap.
